# Codex project instructions

This repository is the independent macOS and Windows link-to-MP3 project whose
historical repository name is `weixin-replay-to-mp3`. Keep link classification,
download, resume, conversion, verification, and storage isolation platform-neutral.
Do not duplicate or rewrite the media pipeline for one operating system.

## First relevant request

When the user asks to install/use this project or supplies an authorized replay,
video, live, course, or direct-media link for MP3 extraction:

1. Detect the native operating system without assuming Python or Git is already usable.
2. On Windows, do **not** stop at “Python/FFmpeg/Git is missing.” If the request asks
   to install or use the product, run the repository's `install-windows.ps1`. It
   installs user-local Python through `winget` when needed and expands its own
   fixed-version, SHA-256-verified embedded source when no checkout is available. Git,
   GitHub source ZIP, and `raw.githubusercontent.com` are not runtime prerequisites.
   FFmpeg, yt-dlp, EJS, and Deno remain pinned in the private runtime.
3. On macOS, run `python3 scripts/bootstrap.py doctor`, read `state` and `preflight`,
   and run `python3 scripts/bootstrap.py install` when the explicit request asks to
   install/use the product and the state is `needs_install`.
4. Do not execute or install anything merely because the repository was opened. An
   install/use request is the authorization for the bounded user-local installation
   above; no separate “please install Python” round trip is needed.
5. After readiness passes for an installation/check request, tell the user exactly
   `已经可以发送链接`.
6. For a link-extraction request, follow the repository's `weixin-replay-to-mp3`
   Skill after readiness passes.

Python 3.10 or newer is required for current cross-platform webpage extraction. Do not
claim full readiness from an older Python runtime.

### Windows first-install command

When a current checkout is available, run:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install-windows.ps1
```

When Git is missing, `git-remote-https` is broken, raw GitHub is unavailable, or there
is no trustworthy local checkout, do not diagnose the product as unsupported. Download
the fixed `v0.4.0` self-contained installer through the jsDelivr multi-CDN endpoint and
run it. The installer validates and expands its embedded source; it never performs a
second GitHub source download:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "weixin-replay-to-mp3-install.ps1"
$urls = @(
  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/delu543/weixin-replay-to-mp3@v0.4.0/install-windows.ps1",
  "https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/delu543/weixin-replay-to-mp3@v0.4.0/install-windows.ps1",
  "https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/delu543/weixin-replay-to-mp3@v0.4.0/install-windows.ps1"
)
$downloaded = $false
foreach ($url in $urls) {
  try {
    Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri $url -OutFile $installer
    if ((Get-Item -LiteralPath $installer).Length -lt 100000) { throw "incomplete installer" }
    $downloaded = $true
    break
  } catch { }
}
if (-not $downloaded) { throw "All installer download channels failed" }
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer
```

If all download channels are blocked, the only required transfer is this same
`install-windows.ps1` file from the tagged release. Once it exists locally, run it
directly; do not request a repository ZIP. The file is also the offline source rescue
kit, although first-time Python/private dependency installation still needs its normal
Microsoft/Python package network unless those dependencies are already cached.

`unsupported_platform` is valid for Linux/remote local-WeChat operation, not for a
native Windows agent. If a Windows result says the README is macOS-only, it is stale or
from the wrong source. Refresh `main` rather than repeating that conclusion. If the
Codex Windows app is configured to run the agent in WSL, switch the agent environment
to Windows native for this product before installation.

## Platform routing

The same `run "<USER_SUPPLIED_LINK>"` command accepts and classifies:

- Weixin Channels `weixin.qq.com/sph/...`;
- Xiaohongshu live replay and share links;
- YouTube/youtu.be;
- X/Twitter;
- direct media URLs, Songy links, and other webpages supported by the pinned generic
  extractor.

For every non-Weixin link, use the shared direct/provider route on macOS and Windows.
Do not open, inspect, send to, or click WeChat for those links. Never import browser
cookies or account tokens automatically; a restricted link must fail clearly or use a
user-authorized local file/artifact.

### macOS

Run the shared command:

```bash
python3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/WeixinReplayToMP3/runtime/weixin_replay_cli.py" \
  run "<USER_SUPPLIED_LINK>"
```

Only a Weixin link may enter the guarded automatic File Transfer Assistant workflow.

### Windows

Use the same provider, download, resume, conversion, and verification pipeline. The
installed PowerShell command is:

```powershell
python "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\WeixinReplayToMP3\runtime\weixin_replay_cli.py" `
  run "<USER_SUPPLIED_LINK>"
```

For Xiaohongshu, YouTube, X/Twitter, direct-media, Songy, and generic webpage routes,
no WeChat step is allowed. For a Weixin link, the command first tries target-bound
local/provider routes. The public release does not claim a verified Windows WeChat UI
adapter and must never send or click blindly. If and only if a Weixin run reports
`Manual playback is required`, tell the user exactly:

1. Open official desktop WeChat.
2. Open the conversation whose title is exactly `文件传输助手`.
3. Send the exact supplied link there, open the newest matching message, and start the
   video. Stop unrelated WeChat video playback.
4. Reply to Codex with `已在文件传输助手打开这个链接，并开始播放` only after that exact
   video is visibly playing.

Wait for that explicit confirmation. Then, and only then, run:

```powershell
python "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\WeixinReplayToMP3\runtime\weixin_replay_cli.py" `
  run "<USER_SUPPLIED_WEIXIN_LINK>" --manual-playback
```

Do not reinterpret `--manual-playback` as permission to operate another chat. It only
authorizes the bounded recent-runtime scan after the user has confirmed the exact
playback. If the Windows WeChat runtime is stored outside the known safe locations,
inspect only playback/runtime directories and set `WEIXIN_REPLAY_RUNTIME_ROOTS` to a
semicolon-separated list. Never point it at chat/contact databases.

If runtime capture is unavailable, offer conversion of a user-authorized local media
file with `convert-file`. Audio-device recording is an explicit last resort; list
devices first, require the user to choose one and confirm playback, and never install
or enable a driver automatically.

Linux and remote/cloud environments are not supported for local WeChat operation.

## Storage

Default data and output roots are outside the repository and bound to an opaque
namespace for the current operating-system account. Provider outputs use stable names
such as `weixin_<id>.mp3`, `xiaohongshu_<id>.mp3`, `youtube_<id>.mp3`, and
`x_<id>.mp3`. If the user explicitly selects a local `--profile`, keep using that same
profile for every resume/verify step.

- macOS runtime/data: `~/Library/Application Support/WeixinReplayToMP3/`
- Windows runtime/data: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WeixinReplayToMP3\`
- MP3 output on both systems: the current account's
  `Downloads/WeixinReplayMP3/<opaque-namespace>/`

## Non-negotiable safety gates

- On macOS, send only the exact supplied link and only after the conversation is
  proven to be exactly `文件传输助手` by the implemented name, header, icon, and
  latest-message gates. Any ambiguity stops before input or Return.
- On Windows, this release does not send messages or click WeChat automatically.
  Require the explicit manual confirmation above before any recent-runtime scan.
- Non-Weixin routes must not touch WeChat on either operating system.
- Webpage extraction must not automatically read browser Cookie stores, tokens,
  passwords, or account databases. Public extraction failure is not permission to
  weaken this boundary.
- Never read chat/contact databases, cookies, tokens, unrelated history, or account
  secrets. Never install a certificate, change the proxy, hook/patch WeChat, or disable
  window protection.
- A protected/white screenshot is not proof that WeChat exited. macOS uses process,
  `WeChatAppEx`, AX, WindowServer, exact-message, and playback assertion evidence.
- Do not run broad stale-cache scans when the exact target was not opened and playback
  was not independently proven.
- Keep `work/`, `.codex/`, outputs, media, reports, screenshots, signed URLs, keys, and
  account data local and untracked.
- Never read or reuse another storage namespace. A shared OS login is not a
  separate-user security boundary; recommend separate OS accounts when different
  humans share a computer.
- Preserve an existing MP3 and target-bound run state. Never overwrite invalid evidence
  or delete a prior result during a retry.

## Completion

Completion requires the final command result, an existing MP3, and a full ffmpeg
decode. Report the exact path, byte count, duration, selected source byte count when
available, provider, and whether the run reused prior verified state. Do not call a
player window, candidate, download start, or partial file successful output.

Before any public push, run `python scripts/release_check.py` on the available local
platform and keep the original development workspaces untouched. Windows CI verifies
the portable Python/installer surface; real Windows WeChat playback/runtime behavior
must be described as pending until it has been exercised on a Windows machine.
